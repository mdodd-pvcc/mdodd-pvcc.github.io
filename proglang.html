	<h1>Programming Terms and Definitions</h1>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Term</th>
			<th>Definition</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Machine Language</td>
			<td>The lowest-level programming language consisting of binary code that is directly executed by the computer's CPU.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Debugging</td>
			<td>The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Assembler</td>
			<td>A program that translates assembly language code into machine language code.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Assembly Language</td>
			<td>A low-level programming language that uses mnemonics to represent machine instructions, making it easier for humans to read and write.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Translator</td>
			<td>A program that translates code from one programming language into another.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Compiler</td>
			<td>A program that translates high-level programming language code into machine language code, typically producing an object program.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Interpreter</td>
			<td>A program that reads and executes code line-by-line, translating each line into machine language code on the fly.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Cross-platform software</td>
			<td>Software that can run on multiple operating systems or platforms.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Natural Language</td>
			<td>A language that is spoken or written by humans, such as English or Spanish.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Formal Language</td>
			<td>A language that is designed for specific purposes, such as programming languages or mathematical notation.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Machine Independence</td>
			<td>The ability of a program to run on different computer systems without modification.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>High-Level Programming Language</td>
			<td>A programming language that is closer to human language, making it easier to read and write than low-level programming languages.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</td>
			<td>A programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that have properties and methods, allowing for code reusability and modularity.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Scripting Language</td>
			<td>A programming language that is used for scripting or automating tasks, often interpreted rather than compiled.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Data Types</td>
			<td>The types of data that can be stored and manipulated in a program.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Integer</td>
			<td>A data type that represents whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Float</td>
			<td>A data type that represents decimal numbers, such as 1.5
        </tr>
        <tr>
			<td>String</td>
			<td>A data type that represents a sequence of characters, such as "hello world".</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Primitive Data Type</td>
			<td>A basic data type that is not composed of other data types, such as integers, floats, and strings.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Data Structure</td>
			<td>A way of organizing and storing data in a computer program, such as arrays, linked lists, and trees.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Python Collection Data Structures</td>
			<td>A set of built-in data structures in Python that can hold multiple values, such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>List</td>
			<td>A collection of values that are ordered and changeable, represented by square brackets [].</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tuple</td>
			<td>A collection of values that are ordered and unchangeable, represented by parentheses ().</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Set</td>
			<td>A collection of unique values that are unordered, represented by curly braces {}.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Dictionary</td>
			<td>A collection of key-value pairs that are unordered, represented by curly braces {} with colons separating the keys and values.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Function</td>
			<td>A block of code that performs a specific task and can be called multiple times throughout a program.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Local Variable</td>
			<td>A variable that is declared and used within a specific function or block of code, and is not accessible outside of that function or block.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Global Variable</td>
			<td>A variable that is declared outside of a function or block of code, and can be accessed and modified from anywhere within a program.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Source Program</td>
			<td>The original code that a programmer writes, often in a high-level programming language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Object Program</td>
